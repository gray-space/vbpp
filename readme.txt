How to:

you need to install python 2.7

"virtualbasic.py" is the main class needed to run "baz-to-bas.py" and "bas-to-baz.py"

To convert ex: project.baz (virtual basic code) into project.bas (applesoft basic) run baz-to-bas.py  and enter source file name project.baz

To convert a regular basic file into virtual basic code run "bas-to-baz.py" in the same way

You can use plottermap.pdf to define coordinates for a figure. Use plotter.py to convert ex: mantis.baz coordinates into basic hplot coords.
